## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a junior data engineer currently learning the foundations of building reliable and efficient data pipelines using SQL and Python. This space reflects my learning journey as I explore core concepts in data engineering, work on small projects, and gradually develop the skills needed to design systems that move and process data effectively.

My primary focus right now is understanding how to structure, transform, and manage data in a way that supports analytics, reporting, and downstream applications. Iâ€™m working with SQL to query, join, and clean datasets from different sources, and Iâ€™m also learning how to write Python scripts that automate data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) tasks.

Through hands-on practice, Iâ€™m gaining experience in tools and libraries commonly used in the data engineering world, such as Pandas, SQLAlchemy, and basic workflow automation. Iâ€™m also beginning to explore how scheduling tools like Apache Airflow can orchestrate complex data workflows.

This repository includes small projects and code samples that demonstrate my current understanding and progressâ€”ranging from basic ETL scripts and data cleaning notebooks to attempts at setting up automated data pipelines. Iâ€™m learning how to handle data from APIs, CSVs, and databases, and how to ensure that pipelines are efficient and repeatable.

As I continue growing in this field, I plan to expand into more advanced topics such as data warehousing, big data tools, and cloud-based pipeline solutions. My goal is to contribute to building systems that enable organizations to make better, data-driven decisions.

Feel free to check out the work, leave feedback, or connect if you're also exploring data engineering or looking to collaborate. Iâ€™m always open to learning more and improving my approach as I develop.
